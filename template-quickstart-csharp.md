Title: 
    The H1 of your Quickstart should be in the format: # Quickstart: [Product Name] client library for [Language]
-->

# Quickstart: [Product Name] client library for .NET

Get started with the [Product Name] client library for .NET. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks.

<!-- 
    After the above line, briefly describe the service. You can often use the first line of the service's docs landing page for this.

    Next, add a bulleted list of the most common tasks supported by the library, prefaced with "Use the [Product Name] client library for [Language] to:". You provide code snippets for these tasks in the Code examples section later in the Quickstart. Keep the list short but include those tasks most developers need to perform with the library.

    Lastly, include the following single line of links targeting the library's companion content at the bottom of the introduction; make adjustments as necessary, for example NuGet instead of PyPi:
-->

Use the [Product Name] client library for .NET to:

* TBD
* TBD

<!--
    Include the following single line of links targeting the library's companion content at the bottom of the introduction; make adjustments as necessary, but try not to include any other links or content in the introduction.
-->

[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.AnomalyDetector?view=azure-dotnet-preview) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/AnomalyDetector) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.AnomalyDetector/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/anomalydetector)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* The current version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).

## Setting up

<!--
    Walk the reader through preparing their environment for working with the client library. Include instructions for creating the Azure resources required to make calls to the service, obtaining credentials, and setting up their local development environment.

    See the "setting up" section for more details: 
    https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-how-to-write-library-quickstart-v2?branch=pr-en-us-2187#setting-up -->

### Create a [Product Name] Azure resource

Azure Cognitive Services are represented by Azure resources that you subscribe to. Create a resource for [Product name] using the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli) on your local machine. You can also:

* Get a [trial key](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/#decision) valid for 7 days for free. After signing up it will be available on the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).  
* View your resource on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

<!-- rename TBD_KEY to something meaningful for your service, like TEXT_ANALYTICS_KEY -->
After you get a key from your trial subscription or resource, [create an environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for the key, named `TBD_KEY`.

### Create a new C# application

Create a new .NET Core application in your preferred editor or IDE. 

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `(product-name)-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: *program.cs*. 

```console
dotnet new console -n (product-name)-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with:

```console
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors. 

```console
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

From the project directory, open the *program.cs* file in your preferred editor or IDE. Add the following `using` directives:

```csharp
using ...
using ...
```

In the application's `Main` method, create variables for your resource's Azure location and key as environment variables. If you created the environment variable after you launched the application, you will need to close and reopen the editor, IDE, or shell running it to access the variable. You will define the methods later.

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args){
...
}
```

### Install the client library

Within the application directory, install the [Product Name] client library for .NET with the following command:

```console
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.[Product Name] --version x.y
```

If you're using the Visual Studio IDE, the client library is available as a downloadable NuGet package.


## Object model

<!-- 
    Briefly introduce and describe the functionality of the library's main classes. Include links to their reference pages.
    Briefly explain the object hierarchy and how the classes work together to manipulate resources in the service.
-->

## Code examples

<!--
    Include code snippets and short descriptions for each task you list in the the bulleted list. Briefly explain each operation, but include enough clarity to explain complex or otherwise tricky operations.

    Include links to the service's reference content when introducing a class for the first time
-->

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the [Product Name] client library for .NET:

* [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
* [link to example task 1]()
* [link to example task 2]()
* [link to example task 3]()

<!--
    change the environment key variable to something descriptive for your service.
    For example: TEXT_ANALYTICS_KEY
-->

### Authenticate the client

<!-- 
    The authentication section (and its H3) is required and must be the first code example in the section if your library requires authentication for use.
-->

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart assumes you've [created an environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account#configure-an-environment-variable-for-authentication) for your [Product Name] key, named `TBD_KEY`.


In a new method, instantiate a client with your endpoint and key. Create an [ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials]() object with your key, and use it with your endpoint to create an [ApiClient]() object.

```csharp

```

### Example task 1

Example: Create a new method to read in the data and add it to a [Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) object as an array of [Points](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/). Send the request with the [send()](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) method

```csharp

```

### Example task 2

Example: Create a new method to read in the data and add it to a [Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) object as an array of [Points](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/). Send the request with the [send()](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) method

```csharp

```

## Run the application

Run the application from your application directory with the `dotnet run` command.

```dotnet
dotnet run
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)

## Troubleshooting

    This section is optional. If you know of areas that people commonly run into trouble, help them resolve those issues in this section
